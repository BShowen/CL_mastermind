# Project 2: Mastermind

### If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.
